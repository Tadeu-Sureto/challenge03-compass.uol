# README - 8th Week Challenge - COMPASS.UOL Internship
Compass UOL SOCIAL homepage development. We maintain the standard of the technologies requested in the requirements. In this challenge we implemented an API for FRONTEND to consume. We provide 2 routes, namely: /user and /user/post. Both routes are from GET and return the list of users and posts for each user respectively. We don't use any database, all the data provided by the API is in the .JSON file. Posts are also not saved. When logging in, the user is forwarded to the home page with his data. The application of the first challenge (login screen and registration screen) was also passed to REACT and Typescript, as it had been entirely developed using pure HTML and CSS.. ðŸš€ðŸš€

Below are the images of the layouts that should be reproduced from the login screen:

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- React
- Express 


## Difficulties Faced
The first difficulty encountered was transferring all the development done in HTML, CSS and JavaScript from the login and registration screen to REACT and TypeScript. In social home we had difficulty developing the necessary routes for the login data to appear on the home screen. Since we don't have much experience with REACT and TypeScript yet, we had to study a lot.
